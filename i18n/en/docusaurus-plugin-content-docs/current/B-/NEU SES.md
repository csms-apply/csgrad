# NEU SES

## Program Overview
The full name is Software Engineering Systems. It is very much a traditional CS program. With the $75 application fee you can apply to three programs by checking boxes — so when you check off NEU MSCS and CS Align, you can also check NEU SES. However, SES is only offered at the Boston campus.

## Admission Preferences & Representative Data Points
Easier to get into than IS. Applicants with a GPA of 80+ (on a 100-point scale) all have a chance.

## Job Outcomes & Data Points
Overall mediocre, but there are cases of Indian students landing offers at Google DeepMind.
