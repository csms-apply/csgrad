# NEU IS

## Program Overview
A career-change-to-CS program that offers co-op opportunities. It's similar to MSCS, and the I-20 lists SE (Software Engineering), which is a CS-related title.

There are multiple campuses. If you want to experience a traditional American college campus life, are young and not in a rush to find a job, and have a strong overall profile, go to the Boston campus. If your goal is landing a job at a big tech company, or you can't stand the Boston winters, come to the Silicon Valley campus.

Normally it takes two years to graduate, but if you do an internship or co-op in between, it may take about two and a half years.

## Admission Threshold
There are even many Ivy League students from other majors who come to NEU to transition into CS.

That said, the admission threshold is not high and is quite friendly.

## Job Outcomes & Data Points
When I previously mentored students looking for 2025 Summer SDE positions, I received many resumes from NEU IS/MSCS/CS Align students. They really do get a lot of interviews from big tech companies (Google, Oracle, Meta, LinkedIn, etc.).
