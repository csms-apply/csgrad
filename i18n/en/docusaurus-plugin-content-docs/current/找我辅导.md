# About Me

I am a Fall 2024 alum who received offers from CMU, Columbia, UIUC, Gatech, and other top universities during my application cycle. I had extensive internship experience during school, having interned at Microsoft, ByteDance, HP, and Baidu.

For Fall 2025, I mentored three students who were admitted to Cornell CS MEng, CMU SESV, and UChicago MPCS respectively.

For Fall 2026, my mentees' offers so far include: Harvard CSE*1, UChicago MPCS offer\*3, CMU MSIN offer \*1, Cornell Tech CM offer\*1, CMU MISM offer\*1, UCI MSWE*1 (see Xiaohongshu for detailed offers and timeline)
# Services Offered

I currently focus on US CS job-oriented master's application consulting services, specifically including:

1. **School Selection & Positioning**
    I will help students with school selection and positioning, going beyond just the information on Open CS to include many strong programs that Open CS has missed. My school selection strategy is to apply broadly and leave no regrets — I recommend applying to at least 20 programs.
2. **Soft Background Enhancement & Career Development Planning**
    I will help students enhance their soft background and plan their career development, especially for applicants targeting the SDE track. I can also provide internal referrals — I have previously helped some students land positions (including at companies like Microsoft).
3. **Regular Meeting Progress Updates**
    I will hold monthly meetings with students to comprehensively track internship progress, GPA performance, paper publications, letters of recommendation preparation, and essay writing (such as SOP and PS). I will also provide targeted advice, such as research direction selection (AI or Systems), and how to more effectively request letters of recommendation from professors, to help students better plan and improve.
4. **Essay Brainstorming**
   - **SOP (Statement of Purpose)**
      I will analyze the student's personal characteristics and growth experiences to craft a Statement of Purpose that aligns with their individual background. I ensure the SOP is tailored to each program's preferences (e.g., CMU MSIN prefers essays about job hunting, NWU MSCS prefers essays about research).
   - **CV (Resume)**
      I will help students optimize their resume to highlight their strengths and experiences. If the student lacks substantial project experience, I will help supplement it.
   - **PS (Personal Statement)**
      I will collaborate with students in discussions to help them write a Personal Statement that is closer to their real story.
   - **RL (Letters of Recommendation)**
      I will discuss recommendation letter content with students and provide improvement suggestions to better align with target program requirements.
5. **Internship Search Coaching**
    I will help students find internship opportunities, provide resume and cover letter optimization advice, and share internship application experience and tips. If a student later joins a US company (such as Microsoft, DE Shaw), I will assist with internal referrals. I will conduct mock interviews to help students improve their interview skills and build confidence for real interviews.
6. **Program Interview Coaching**
    I will provide interview coaching for US CS program interviews, such as CMU MSIN, Columbia MSCS, etc., helping students better prepare for and handle interviews.
7. **Offer Analysis**
    I will help students analyze the pros and cons of their received offers and choose the most suitable program. I am committed to a long-term approach and promise to be responsible for every student I mentor.
