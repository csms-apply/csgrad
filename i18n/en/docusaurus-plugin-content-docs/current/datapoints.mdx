# CS Application DataPoints

In 2026, we will further enhance our technical support capabilities, including:

1.📊 Searching for trends in admission preferences across programs over the past two years

2.🎯 Precise positioning analysis based on similar applicant profiles

3.🔥 "Offer Timeline" — heatmaps showing the distribution and peak periods of admission/rejection decisions

4.📈 Through data-driven and visual analysis, providing future applicants with more scientific, transparent, and actionable decision support.
