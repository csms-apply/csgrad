# NWU MSCS

## Program Review
Evanston has beautiful scenery, good safety, and the school is well-funded with nice facilities. Lake Michigan is gorgeous.

The program is 4 quarters / one and a half years. There are three tracks: thesis, project, and course. The thesis and project tracks require finding an advisor to write a paper or do a project. The advantage is you can extend up to two extra quarters to graduate (i.e., 6 quarters / two years). During those two extra quarters, you only need to take one placeholder course at $100 -- but overall it's still not cheap.

The downside is that tuition is very expensive, at least $76K+ total.

## Admission Threshold & Data Points
High GPA from a US undergrad is a safe bet. Joint programs may not be as convincing as a full four-year US undergrad degree. Official emails explicitly state they prefer high GPA + strong research backgrounds, with zero mention of internships. Therefore, if you want to come to NWU MSCS, doing research and getting high grades is recommended.

1. NWU CS undergrad, GPA 3.95

## Job Outcomes
Career services are essentially useless. Job outcomes are mediocre -- this program is actually better suited for PhD applications / transferring to a PhD.
