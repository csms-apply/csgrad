# NYU Tandon MSCS

## Program Overview
Important to distinguish this from NYU COURANT's MSCS -- COURANT's MSCS is very academically oriented, while Tandon's is very career-oriented. Tandon only has a few buildings, somewhat similar to CMU's SV campus. NYU Tandon is located in Brooklyn. It's a two-year program with non-trivial costs -- budget around 1.1M RMB. You can graduate early in one and a half years, or delay graduation.

The last semester has a co-op, which is great.
