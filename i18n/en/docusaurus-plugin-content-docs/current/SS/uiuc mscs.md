# UIUC MSCS

## Program Overview

UIUC's flagship program. Can be treated as a PhD application -- it's best to reach out to professors before applying. Fully funded, target PhD. Students from UIUC itself have a 5-year BS-MS program that leads to the MSCS. (Reviewer's note: some friends applying for 25 Fall have reported that UIUC MSCS is no longer guaranteed to be fully funded, which somewhat reduces its value proposition.)




## Admission Preferences

Extremely high difficulty. Best to reach out to professors before applying. A UIUC CS professor stated that in 2023, there were 2,427 applicants and 103 offers, for an acceptance rate of 4.2%. See the image below for details.
