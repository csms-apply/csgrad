# Yale MSCS 2 year

## Program Overview
Fully funded -- full tuition waiver, but you need to TA throughout. Annual enrollment is around 15 students. Yale MSCS 2 year is a research-based program that requires strong publications and connections.

However, even for the 2-year program, CPT is not approved, so you cannot count on interning externally over the summer. The only way to intern is by using pre-completion OPT.
