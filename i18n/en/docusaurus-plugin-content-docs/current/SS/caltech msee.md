# Caltech MSEE

# Program Overview
LA weather is unbeatable, school prestige is unbeatable, and the number of admitted students is far fewer than Stanford. Very friendly for career changers to CS: of the 135 credits required to graduate, only 54 need to be EE classes. Many CS courses, such as the well-known 156 Learning Systems, are cross-labeled as CS-EE, so in theory you could take all CS courses and still graduate.

The program is 9 months long, but can be extended by half a year.
# Admission Preferences

15 students admitted per year. About 1/3 are mainland China undergrads, basically from Tsinghua, Peking, and C5 universities. The rest are international undergrads.
