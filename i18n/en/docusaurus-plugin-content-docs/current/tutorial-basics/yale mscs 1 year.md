# Yale MSCS 1 Year

# Program Overview
Many CS master's programs at top universities are one-year programs, such as Yale and UC Berkeley. The ones that offer two-year programs are either extremely hard to get into (Stanford MSCS / Stanford MSEE / CMU MSCS) or simply don't exist — for example, MIT EECS (the only way to get an MIT EECS master's is to drop out of the MIT EECS PhD program). Therefore, Yale is a popular choice for many CS students in China who want to fulfill their dream of attending a top-10 university. Yale's campus is beautiful, resembling Hogwarts, and Yale's CS theory group is very strong.

# Admission Preferences & Representative Data Points
Yale places extremely heavy emphasis on hard metrics. According to community-reported data points, internships are not considered, top-conference papers are not considered — only three items on your resume matter: GPA >= 3.8, GRE >= 328, TOEFL >= 105. (Note: Starting from Fall 2024 and Fall 2025 admission cycles, there have been data points of admits with GRE scores of 325 or 322. However, the fundamental nature of Yale MSCS admissions as a large-scale weighted metrics calculator has not changed.) There is no research experience requirement; the official website also explicitly states: "This is not a research degree, so research experience is not required."

Admitted students from mainland China mostly come from 985 universities (in 2022, Yale admitted nearly 20 students from Zhejiang University alone). International undergrads are more diverse, but the common theme is a prestigious university + high GPA.

# Job Outcomes & Data Points
2023 was quite rough (based on data points from people around me, out of over 30 students, only two landed jobs). Overall, outcomes depend heavily on the job market conditions in a given year — a better market means better results. However, compared to UC Berkeley EECS MEng, which is also a one-year program, Yale MSCS does not have a significant advantage. It is recommended for people who already have substantial internship experience or full-time SDE experience in China before coming to Yale MSCS.
