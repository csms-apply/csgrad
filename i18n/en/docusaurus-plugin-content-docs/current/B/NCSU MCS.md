# NCSU MCS

## Program Overview
Suitable for career changers to CS, with good job outcomes. North Carolina is a great area with many large tech companies nearby. The program workload is generally lighter compared to most popular CS programs discussed online, leaving ample time for LeetCode grinding and resume submissions.



## Admission Preferences & Data Points
Very friendly; can be used as a safety school. GPA 3.2+ and TOEFL 100 are sufficient.

Most students are career changers from 985 universities and CS majors from 211 universities, with a few US undergrads as well.

## Job Outcomes
Internship landing rate among Chinese students is slightly above 50%, but an Indian friend told me that 90% of people he knows found internships.

Although NCSU doesn't have a prestigious school halo, it won't hold you back either. Some graduates have gone to Facebook, including a well-known content creator on Bilibili.

The 2022 summer landing rate was 87%. For details, see: https://leslierp.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/2022/07/intern-survey-2022.pdf
