# USC CS28

## Program Overview
A two-year program, famously known for only looking at GPA. The class size is enormous (between CS28 and CS37), approaching nearly a thousand students.

## Admission
Only looks at background and GPA. Recommendation letters are optional. Rolling admissions. All applicants from all schools are pooled together and ranked by GPA, with offers sent from top to bottom. 985/211 university backgrounds are valued.

Internships and research are not considered. Recommended as a safety school for high-GPA candidates.

## RA / PhD Transfer Opportunities

Very difficult. USC CS-related programs have enormous class sizes, making it very hard to find RA opportunities, and transferring to a PhD is also very difficult.
