# UTSU MSCS
## Program Overview
Full name: Utah State University MSCS. The biggest advantage is the full funding opportunity -- the department pays $2,000/month for TA or RA work, which is very generous. It's essentially a fully funded MS program. Additionally, UTSU MSCS allows up to four years of study (for non-international students), so you can leave whenever you find a job, which is great. Unlike Yale MSCS 2-year / UIUC MSCS / UW-Madison MSCS where you're in the same applicant pool as PhD candidates and it's nearly impossible to get in due to the intense competition, this program is very suitable for ordinary applicants without a strong research background who want to apply for a fully funded MS.


## TA/RA Application
More than half of all graduate students at USU receive Financial Assistance including scholarships, grants and more. Apply early -- there is an option for this in the application system.
