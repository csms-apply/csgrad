# Emory MSCS

## Program Overview
The Emory MSCS program is offered by the Department of Computer Science (under the Laney Graduate School), with a typical duration of 2 years (two academic years, fall and spring). Most students complete the program within two years, while those with strong backgrounds and fast progress may graduate in 1.5 years (3 semesters).

The program is divided into a CS Track and a BMI Track. Emory is known for its strengths in biochemistry and medical technology, making it a great choice for students interested in bioinformatics, biocomputing, and clinical technology. Research opportunities in the CS track are mainly concentrated in healthcare-related ML/AI and NLP fields. The program maintains Emory's tradition of small-scale, elite training. The low student-to-faculty ratio makes it easier for master's students to find desirable research opportunities and build close relationships with professors. Additionally, the small class sizes are friendly to students with undergrad backgrounds from mainland China, helping them transition smoothly.

## Courses
Emory MSCS has a relatively limited course selection, with fewer courses offered each semester, and some courses listed on the website are not actually available. Master's students typically take classes alongside undergraduates and PhD students. The overall course workload is manageable, but the content is relatively traditional and rarely involves cutting-edge industry-level projects.

The CS Track offers three options: Coursework, Project, and Thesis, but there are only 3-4 required courses, and the range of electives is relatively limited.

## Admission
The Emory MSCS program has a relatively low admission threshold. Many applicants whose undergraduate major is not CS but who have some programming and quantitative background have a chance of being admitted.

1. Emory CS undergrad, GPA 4.0
2. IIT CS undergrad, GPA 8.68/10

## Job Outcomes & Data Points
Emory is not a school with an intense job hunting atmosphere. Many master's students hesitate between job hunting and pursuing a PhD. Emory's Career Center and Career Fair are largely unhelpful. The vast majority of Chinese students use the MSCS program as a stepping stone for PhD applications, and a significant portion stay at Emory to pursue a PhD after graduation.

1. Southern University of Science and Technology CS undergrad, with Huawei internship and one year full-time at Lilith Games, landed a small company intern position
2. Wake Forest University CS undergrad, with Baidu + two years of internship at a small company in China (remote during the pandemic), landed AWS SDE intern

## Value for Money
Tuition is approximately $50K per year. All students admitted to the MSCS program automatically receive partial tuition scholarships (30%-50%). The overall cost of living in Atlanta is not high, with monthly rent budgets ranging from $1,000 to $2,000. Compared to schools on the East and West Coasts, this program offers relatively good value.
