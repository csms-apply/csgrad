# Passing the FAANG Resume Screening

I was very fortunate that during my 2025 summer internship search, I received interviews from all FAANG companies and passed every interview I participated in (using NVIDIA in place of Netflix here). Here's how to pass the resume screening at FAANG and receive a virtual onsite.

Facebook (Meta): Relies heavily on HR reach-outs and internal referrals. The people I know who got into Meta fall into two groups: the first group received proactive HR reach-outs, and the second group immediately asked seniors/alumni for internal referrals as soon as positions opened. As the saying goes, "no referral, no Meta." Meta's internal referral policy requires processing referral applications within 14 days. If you're looking for an internal referral for a Meta internship, you need to act as soon as positions open. In late September 2024, Meta opened positions but only gave a few days for intern referral submissions before closing the channel.

Apple: Very dependent on resume match. Only when a team thinks you're a match for their work will they schedule an interview. For example, I had previously worked on extensions at Edge, and this team worked on extensions at Safari — so they scheduled an interview.

Amazon: Internal referrals aren't very useful; applying on the first day positions open is more effective. You can check GitHub intern repositories to see if Amazon has opened positions. The OA is very easy — the hard part is receiving the OA and the BQ portion. The coding section has always been easy. For the BQ portion, you can refer to YouTube videos by Soroush summarizing the questions or resources shared on forums. Ideally, each BQ answer should hit two to three LP (Leadership Principles).

Netflix: I've rarely seen anyone get an interview, but the compensation is extremely high — intern pay is about $110/hr.

Google: Internal referrals help, but it's also quite random. My personal data point: In June 2024, I mass-applied to Google internships with no response. In October, I asked a senior to give me a strong referral and reapplied — then I received an OA.
