# How to Take Prerequisite CS Courses That Come With a Transcript
After understanding [what CS prerequisite courses you need to take](转码需要补的专业课.md), the next step is figuring out how to actually take them.
There is one key principle: taking a MOOC without receiving a transcript does not count as completing a CS prerequisite. MOOCs don't come with transcripts, and the schools you're applying to have no way of knowing
whether you actually took the course. You must find programs that have exams, offer credits, and provide official transcripts.

## Institutions That Provide Official Transcripts
1. WGU (practical courses, very SDE-oriented)
2. University of the People (in my opinion, the best value school — it offers a full range of courses)
3. ASU Online
4. University of Colorado Boulder Post-Bacc–Applied Computer Science

All of the above are online programs, making it convenient for students in China to take courses remotely and receive official transcripts.
## University of the People

TL;DR: A truly affordable "people's university" — the cheapest option here at only $140 per course. It offers foundational courses such as Databases 1,
Communications and Networking, Software Engineering 1, Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics,
College Algebra, and Introduction to Statistics. This is more than enough for career changers to complete their prerequisite courses.

## WGU
WGU is also a great option with very practical courses, such as Web Development Foundations, Linux Foundations,
Java Frameworks, Data Structures and Algorithms I, Software Engineering, Network and Security - Foundations, and Operating Systems for Computer Scientists.
Also recommended.

## ASU Online
Tuition is $8,451 per semester, which is acceptable. They offer Data Structures, Operating Systems, Compilers, and other essential courses, but it's a bit expensive, so not as strongly recommended.

## University of Colorado Boulder
They offer Computer Systems, Algorithms, Machine Learning, Software Development Methods and Tools,
Computer Science 2: Data Structures, Discrete Structures, and Principles of Programming Languages.
They also have in-person courses and offer a second bachelor's degree — students already in the US can consider attending in person.
