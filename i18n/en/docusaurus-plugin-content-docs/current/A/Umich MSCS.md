# UMich MSCS/MSCSE

## Program Overview

Being a TA gets you free tuition + $3,000/month stipend -- very nice. Many UMich or UM-SJTU Joint Institute students just stay and do their master's here.
The program is quite flexible -- it can be one year, 1.5 years, or two years. You graduate whenever you find a new grad job.
400-level courses are very hands-on with substantial workload, but they're all very useful. Younger lecturers typically teach much better than professors. 500-level courses aren't very useful for job hunting, but the workload is generally lighter -- you can take a few 500-level courses during your job hunting semester.
Graduation requires taking one hardware course.

The location is not great and can be depressing. Most CS courses are on North Campus. Students considering buying a car are encouraged to do so. The school facilities overall are quite good.

## MS vs MSE
UMich offers two CS master's degrees: **MS (Master of Science)** and **MSE (Master of Science in Engineering)**. The two differ only in name; the degree requirements are completely the same:
- Students with an undergraduate engineering degree (BSE) can apply for either MS or MSE.
- Students with a non-engineering degree (e.g., BS, BA) can only apply for MS.

## Admission Threshold & Data Points

### For Current Students
For UMich undergrads, it's recommended to apply for the master's degree through the **SUGS (Sequential Undergraduate/Graduate Studies)** program:
- **Program Benefits**
  - Undergraduate and graduate courses can overlap (up to 15 credits), saving time and money.
  - The master's degree can typically be completed in 1-1.5 years.

- **SUGS Application Requirements**
  - Cumulative GPA of **3.6 or above**.
  - Must complete the following courses before applying with grades of B+ or above:
    - EECS 281
    - EECS 270/370
  - Must complete at least 4 upper-level CS courses (e.g., EECS 370, EECS 376) with grades of B+ or above.
  - Major must be DS, CS, CE, EE, or a CS-related minor.

### For External Applicants
Admission difficulty is relatively high. Recommendations:
- Spots for external applicants are limited, with few admissions. Most spots are prioritized for UMich undergraduate SUGS students.
- External applicants are advised to have:
  - Outstanding GPA and research record.
  - Strong course background, grades, and recommendation letters.

External students are not recommended to apply blindly unless they are extremely passionate about UMich and have exceptionally strong credentials!!

There are some industry partnership programs (e.g., MDP) where strong performance can lead to internship interviews/opportunities.

## Transferring to PhD
Friendly environment for this. Quite a few students transfer directly to PhD from within the school.
