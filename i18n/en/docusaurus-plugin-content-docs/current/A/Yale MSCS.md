# Yale MSCS 1 year

## Program Overview
Yale's brand name is top-tier. MSCS 1-year allows deferral by one semester or one year.

If you're a US undergrad, you can try deferring one semester and enrolling in Spring to obtain CPT, which solves the common problem of one-year programs not allowing internships. For detailed steps, please refer to [How to Get CPT with Spring Enrollment](../useful_docs/Spring%20入学如何拿CPT.md). The specific details of CPT approval should be double-checked with the school.


## Admission Threshold & Data Points
Essentially a weighted GPA calculator. In previous years, GRE was strictly cut off at 328. Recent years show signs of loosening, with data points of 325 being admitted.
ZJU is a feeder school -- in previous years, the CS + ZJU-UIUC joint program could yield 20+ admissions. Internships and research are not considered. The program officially states that "research is not required." They only look at GPA, undergraduate institution, TOEFL, and GRE.

1. US undergrad, top 100, CS, GPA 3.92
2. UW-Madison CS+Math undergrad, GPA 3.9
3. University of Hartford CE, GPA 3.97
4. UIUC Math+CS, GPA 3.91
5. UCSB CS undergrad, GPA 4.0, multiple small company internships in China
6. NYU CS undergrad, GPA 3.95, GRE 332
7. UW CS undergrad, GPA 3.9

## Job Outcomes & Data Points
Average -- mainly because without a US internship, it's very hard to find new grad positions. Job landings mainly rely on TikTok and Amazon recruiting. 24 Fall new grad landing rate was 10%-15%. Overall, not as good as UCB EECS MEng, which is also a one-year program.

Some data points of successful landings:
1. Wuhan University CS undergrad, one year of TikTok internship in China, landed TikTok new grad upon graduation
2. Wuhan University Software Engineering undergrad, four-month internship at Ant Group, landed 2 Sigma
3. Tulane University Math+CS undergrad, no internship, landed a small company
4. NYU undergrad, had Baidu internship, landed AWS new grad
5. UW CS undergrad, had AWS intern, landed DoorDash new grad
6. Waterloo undergrad, four-month small company internship in Canada, landed Google new grad
7. Yale CS undergrad, three years of startup experience and small company internship, landed Google new grad
