# UPenn MCIT


## Program Overview
This is the ceiling program for zero-background career changers to CS. There's a strict requirement that applicants must not have taken more than 2 CS major courses. If you've taken a substantial number of CS courses, please check out UPenn's CIS program instead. You need to complete 10 courses to graduate.
If you don't want to take a required course, you can apply to waive it by passing an exam. You can apply to extend graduation to 2.5 years; a GPA above 3.3 is sufficient.
Great for taking it slow while job hunting. You can dual with CIS -- very flexible. Applicants are strongly recommended to apply in the first round: first-round acceptance rate is 17%, second-round acceptance rate is 8%.
