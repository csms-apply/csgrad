# Columbia DS

## Program Overview

For students whose undergrad was not in CS and who simply want to use this program to transition into CS, it is not a great fit — consider CS, CE, or even EE instead. The program leans more toward DS and ML. Overall, the DS curriculum is fairly comprehensive. There is a capstone project that can be put on your resume, but you must complete certain prerequisite courses before enrolling, so it is not very helpful for job hunting during the first summer. Course selection is relatively flexible — courses taken during undergrad can be waived, and extra electives can be freely chosen from CS and Statistics.

If your undergrad is not in CS and you want to use this program to transition into CS, please look at CS, CE, or even EE instead.

## Job Outcomes & Data Points
Average

Overall performance is fairly average. The school does provide some career resources — for example, DSI sends DS students a weekly "DSI Opportunities" email summarizing full-time and internship positions. During the semester, there are also company Resume Drops emails where student resumes get pushed directly to HR/Hiring Managers. DSI also hosts its own career fair, with companies that have close ties to DSI. However, job hunting ultimately depends on individual ability. Classmates' career directions are diverse — some join large companies, while others go to smaller ones.
