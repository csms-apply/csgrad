# NYU DS

## Program Overview
Very well-suited for students with a CS/DS/Math undergrad who want to do an MS to strengthen their research background and then transfer to a PhD. You can follow nyucds on Instagram to see how much they emphasize research. Not great for career changers to CS; better suited for those seeking DS jobs.
Quite a few students transfer to PhD within the department. For students interested in research, you can start emailing professors right after admission — many programs allow you to join a research group as early as the summer.



The coursework is rigorous and mathematically demanding, so many admitted students come from math backgrounds. Most students here are aiming for a PhD or DS jobs. If you study diligently for two years, the knowledge you gain will essentially prepare you for any DS position. (That said, in the era of LLMs, DS roles also require ML/DL skills.) The program does an excellent job teaching the knowledge needed to become a Data Scientist. The career fair tends to attract more NYC financial industry companies.


## Admission Preferences & Representative Data Points
Tends to admit US-undergrad top-50 math/stat/econ majors. The student body is roughly 1/3 Chinese, 1/3 Korean + Indian, and 1/3 white and other ethnicities.

Official admission report: In the 2021 intake cycle, the average GPA was 3.87. Our students' transcripts usually include As and Bs (only), and we expect stronger grades in more relevant subject matter (see below) from those coming from less selective institutions.
