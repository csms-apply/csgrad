# Gatech ECE

# Program Overview

Degree: Master of Science in Electrical & Computer Engineering, abbreviated MSECE.

Campus: Primarily the Atlanta main campus; you can also spend time at the Lorraine (France) or Shenzhen campuses.

Graduation requirements: 30 credits + one mandatory easy course, ECE 6001 (presentations + startup/entrepreneurship discussions).

Pace: Can be completed in as few as 3 semesters; if you want to take it slow, officially you can stretch it up to 5 years — stay enrolled, keep developing your skills, and graduate after landing a job. You can use GRIP to return home for internships while maintaining school enrollment, which does not affect CPT applications. PhD transfer-friendly.

Course selection flexibility: 6 ECE core courses of your choice (you can pick all software-focused ones); plus 4 free electives from any school — CS / CSE / ISyE are all fair game.

One-line summary: If you want to study hardcore chip design, there is a path for that; if you want to transition to CS, you can arrange your schedule to look almost like a CS degree.

# Course Selection
How do you actually snag courses?

Two-round system —

Round 1: Reserved for your own department only — first come, first served.

Round 2: Opens up to all university courses right before the semester starts. Popular CS courses require watching the waitlist for openings. On the last day of Round 2 in the afternoon, a free-for-all begins — waitlists are cleared and you can race to grab remaining spots.

No extra charge for overloading — beyond 12 credits it is free. If you have the stamina, nobody will stop you from taking 4+1 or even 4+2 courses.
