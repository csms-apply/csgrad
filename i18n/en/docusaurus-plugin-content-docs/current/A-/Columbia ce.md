# Columbia MSCE
# Program Overview
A 1.5-year program. You can do a summer internship, but fall co-op is not supported. There is a thesis option — if you find a professor, you can extend your graduation timeline.

# Job Hunting Review
The school's career fair is basically useless. I heard that Bloomberg used to be a safety net, but now I have not heard of anyone landing there either. However, among people around me, those who applied early could still get interviews. As a data point: I had zero internships and still passed the resume screening and received offers from Meta and Amazon. But it is true that Columbia is not a target school for some companies. With zero internships, I aced the Uber and Snowflake OAs but got rejected anyway. A classmate with multiple FAANG internships also got rejected after getting perfect scores on OAs. For job hunting, public school programs like UIUC and UCSD CS75 are definitely better.

# Course Review
There is a common misconception that Columbia has a heavy workload because of four courses per semester — this is actually wrong. CE has extremely flexible course selection: you can freely take CS courses, and CE and MSCS have the same priority for CS course enrollment. Five core courses can all be software-focused, and there are many easy course options. Here are a few recommendations with workload basically equal to zero:
Modeling: counts as a core course. It is a statistics course. If you took an undergrad stats course covering multidimensional random walks, you can coast on prior knowledge.
Verification: core course. Similar to discrete math, covering FSMs and logic.
Data Center Processing: core course. Group project to write a short paper.

# Admission Info & Data Points
There are about 60 students total, roughly 60% Chinese, 30% Indian. The Chinese students' backgrounds are quite diverse — mainland Chinese undergrads range from second-tier universities to Peking University, and US undergrads come from various schools.

1. Bard College at Simon's Rock, Physics undergrad, GPA 4.0
2. Purdue University CS undergrad, 5 years full-time at Microsoft
3. University of Nottingham Ningbo China, CS undergrad, two-month small-company internship
4. Union College CE undergrad
5. NYU CE undergrad
6. OSU CE undergrad

# Choosing Between MSCS and CE
The admission threshold for CS is higher and can sometimes be unpredictable. Since the engineering school only allows you to apply to one program, if — like me — you definitely want to be in New York, I recommend CE. After all, in Manhattan your only options are Columbia and NYU.
