# Gatech CSE

## Program Overview
The cost-effectiveness is truly outstanding.
Let's start with what matters most -- it's cheap! One semester of four courses with tuition and fees combined is around $17k+, which is way more reasonable than many schools that charge $40-50k. On top of that, being a TA/RA can waive tuition + provide $800/month for living expenses (essentially getting a free master's degree).

In addition to using TA/RA to waive tuition, non-US undergrads can use the "reduce academic load" option to lower workload in the first semester, while also reducing tuition as a part-time student and focusing entirely on finding an internship.

The CSE program offers really flexible course selection. Besides four core courses (leaning computational/math), the rest is basically the same as CS -- you can take CS courses with the same priority as MSCS students. The best part is that CSE students don't need to pick a specialization (since CSE itself is a specialization under MSCS), so as long as you can convince the academic advisor, almost everything counts for credit. This makes it even more flexible than MSCS, and you can definitely graduate in three semesters unless you want to stay longer.

The I-20 says Computer Science, so you can write Computer Science as your major on your resume for job searching. Also, internal program transfers at GT are easy -- just finish the courses and you can transfer to CS. Apparently the theoretical threshold is a 3.5 GPA in the first semester (needs verification).

## Admission Threshold & Standards

MSCS > CSE CoC >= CSE ISyE > other units

In terms of admission difficulty itself, CoC prefers applicants from target schools and basically only looks at GPA/GRE/TOEFL. Other tracks might be a bit easier -- you can choose a less popular track to get in and then transfer to CoC or MSCS. Choosing a different home unit can indeed lower admission difficulty, but as difficulty decreases, program headcount also drops exponentially, so keep this trade-off in mind. For example, I've never actually seen anyone enrolled in CSE (Math); I suspect some home units' CSE programs are designed for people already admitted to other programs or current students doing a dual degree. So one viable path is: apply to another GT program, get in, then dual-degree. For example, some ISyE programs (GT's ISyE has many programs) or EE, architecture, biology, chemistry programs -- but these aren't very friendly to applicants with CS backgrounds.


## Job Outcomes & Data Points
Similar to CS -- career outcomes include Meta, Google, etc.

## PhD Transfer
As long as a professor agrees, you can transfer to the PhD program.

## Campus & Living
GT's campus has a lot of hills -- going to class feels like hiking. Fortunately, there are campus shuttles with many routes, running every 15 minutes. During holidays, there's even a special line to supermarkets, reaching a Target about 20 minutes away. As for dining, 80% of people eat at Panda Express and Chick-fil-A. I personally think Panda is decent, and buying the school's Dining Dollars saves 8.9% in tax.

Atlanta's safety is mediocre overall. I just live in the school dorms for peace of mind. Sometimes the Citizens App reports someone with a gun somewhere, but it's generally unrelated to campus. MARTA (the subway) only has one cross-shaped line. Getting to an Asian supermarket takes 30 minutes, and it's really inconvenient without a car. Fortunately, most people use Walmart+ delivery, and if that doesn't work, they order from Weee.

GT's mandatory four courses per semester is really intense. Basically after the first two weeks, there's something due every week. Even if you pick the easiest courses, the due dates will still overwhelm you... because the hard courses are truly hardcore, and even the easier courses have heavy requirements and workloads. Additionally, GT allows you to take some undergraduate courses that don't count toward graduation credits but can be used to meet full-time enrollment requirements -- you can pick some high-quality foundational CS courses this way.
