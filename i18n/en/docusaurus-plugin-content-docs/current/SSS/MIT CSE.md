# MIT CSE

## Program Overview
Full name: Master of Science in Computational Science and Engineering.
Focused on computation and foundational sciences, with courses primarily covering optimization and numerical computing. CSE is jointly offered with eight departments: Mathematics, Aerospace, Chemical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Nuclear Science and Engineering. This is not a CS program -- if you want to apply to a pure CS program, check out MIT EECS instead. MIT CSE is also fully funded, with full tuition coverage + $3k stipend without needing to TA.

MIT CSE has currently stopped admitting students. It is uncertain when they will resume admitting external applicants (26fall update):
