# Cornell CS MENG

## Program Overview
As of 25 Fall, the school has confirmed that extension to 1.5 years is possible and CPT can be approved. Cornell has two CS programs on different campuses -- one in Ithaca and one on Roosevelt Island -- both are one-year programs. Without special circumstances, extension is very difficult. Spring admits can get CPT approved, provided they are US undergrads who have been full-time students in the US for at least two semesters. The S-tier rating is because in one year it satisfies: low cost + high reputation + summer internship availability + being able to intern in China for a long time during senior year to strengthen your soft background, which helps with finding internships in the US + no coursework pressure in the first semester, allowing you to go all-in on job searching.

MEng requires completing a project. You can work with a professor on research, collaborate with a company, or even join a startup project at Cornell Tech -- very practical. Coursework is light; some courses are easy to coast through, but if you want a challenge, you can pick demanding ones like Advanced Algorithms or Distributed Systems, which have hardcore workloads.

The S-tier rating is mainly because: US undergrad students can defer a semester and enroll in spring to get CPT, which solves the common problem of one-year programs not allowing internships. For detailed instructions, please refer to [How to Get CPT with Spring Enrollment](../useful_docs/Spring%20入学如何拿CPT.md). Specific CPT approval details should be double-checked with the school.


## Admission Threshold & Data Points
Speaking score requirement of 28. Mostly US undergrads + Indian students. Undergrad schools include:
UCSD, UCLA, UIUC, Brandeis, NYU, Penn State, University of Toronto, Waterloo

## Job Outcomes
Landing rate is roughly 60%. The main pain point is that extension is troublesome. For extension requests, it's recommended to cite health reasons.
