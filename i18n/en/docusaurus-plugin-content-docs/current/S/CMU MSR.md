# CMU MSR

## Program Overview
Can be treated like a PhD application. MSR is a research-oriented two-year program totaling 168 credits, split evenly between coursework and research. The program's purpose is to train students for research and transitioning to a PhD. Every student is required to work with an advisor on a thesis, with the same requirements as PhD students. However, transferring to a PhD within CMU requires re-applying, and there's no guarantee you'll stay with the same advisor, which is a bit awkward.

Full funding is not guaranteed either. It mainly depends on your interview performance with the advisor and your familiarity with the research area, as well as your proficiency with the relevant toolchain. You might only get partial coverage, and it's even possible that you won't find an advisor at all.

## Advantages
1. Two-year duration gives you an extra chance -- you can survive tough times and get an additional H-1B lottery attempt.
2. If PhD applications don't go well, you can come here for two years and re-apply.

## Disadvantages

If you come to this program for job search purposes, even if you find an internship, you need your advisor's approval to go. Your advisor may also refuse to let you go.
