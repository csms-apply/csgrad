# CMU MSML

## Program Overview
A flagship program under SCS. The curriculum is almost entirely ML-related courses, with 9 required ML courses. Working as an RA can cover up to 75% of tuition, though this depends on whether your advisor is willing to pay and how much. If you transfer to a PhD within the department, you only need one additional course, which is great. Many friends around me have transferred to PhD. ML is a closely connected department with frequent events and seminars, so everyone knows each other well.
