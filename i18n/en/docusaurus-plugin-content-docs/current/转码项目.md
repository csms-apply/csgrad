# Career Switcher Programs

Career switcher programs are divided into completely zero-background programs (no CS prerequisite courses taken at all) and partially zero-background programs (some CS prerequisite courses taken). If a student is from an economics/business/biology background and has not taken prerequisite courses such as Data Structures, Computer Organization, Operating Systems, etc.,
they can refer to [Prerequisite Courses for Career Switchers](useful_docs/转码需要补的专业课) to plan their coursework.

## Completely Zero-Background Career Switch


1. NEU CS Align
2. UPenn MCIT (favors high GPA from prestigious schools, GPA 3.9+ is relatively safe)
3. [UChicago MPCS](A-/uchicago%20mpcs.md)
4. [UCI MSWE](B+/uci%20mswe.md)
5. USC CS37
6. NEU ISB
7. [UIUC MSIM](B-/UIUC%20MSIM.md)
8. Columbia CS Bridge
9. NYU Tandon MSCS Bridge
10. [JHU MSECS](A-/jhu%20msecs.md)
11. NEU ISB
12. CMU MITS


## Requires Some Prerequisite Courses
1. [Duke ECE](B+/duke%20ece.md)
2. Duke Game Design
3. [Columbia MSCS](A/columbia%20mscs.md)
4. [Columbia EE](A-/Columbia%20ee.md)
5. [CMU MSIN](S/cmu%20msin.md) (there are past data points of students with 5-year Clinical Medicine undergrad degrees who completed prerequisites and switched to CS, as well as many EE/IS/Cybersecurity students who were admitted)
6. [CMU MISM](B+/cmu%20mism.md)
7. [Emory MSCS](B/Emory%20MSCS.md)
8. [UCSD CS75](A+/ucsd%20cs75.md) (there are past data points of Math majors who completed prerequisites and were admitted)
9. [Gatech CSE](A+/Gatech%20CSE.md) (you can first apply to a less competitive track, such as ISyE, then transfer to MSCS after enrollment)
10. [UIUC ECE](B/UIUC%20ECE%20MENG.md)
11. [UW EE PMP](A/uw%20ee%20pmp.md)
12. [NCSU MCS](B-/NCSU%20MCS.md)
